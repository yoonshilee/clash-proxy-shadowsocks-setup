# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This file tells an agent how to work with this repository and, most importantly, which machine each action belongs to.

## Two Endpoints

There are two different environments in this project. Do not mix them.

### 1. VPS Side

This is the remote Linux server that hosts Xray `VLESS + REALITY` and Caddy.

Relevant files:

- `server/install-centos.sh`
- `server/install-ubuntu.sh`
- `server/install.sh`
- `server/scripts/install-common.sh`
- `server/scripts/open-firewall-centos.sh`
- `server/scripts/open-firewall-ubuntu.sh`
- `server/uninstall-centos.sh`
- `server/uninstall-ubuntu.sh`
- `server/uninstall.sh`

Agent rules on the VPS side:

- Run VPS install commands only on the VPS.
- Before installing, identify the VPS distribution first by reading `/etc/os-release`.
- If `ID=ubuntu` or `ID_LIKE` contains `debian`, run `sudo bash server/install-ubuntu.sh`.
- If `ID=centos`, `rhel`, `rocky`, `almalinux`, `fedora`, or `ID_LIKE` contains `rhel` / `fedora`, run `sudo bash server/install-centos.sh`.
- `server/install.sh` is only a convenience dispatcher. Agents should still identify the OS first and choose the matching installer explicitly.
- Run `server/uninstall.sh`, `server/uninstall-centos.sh`, or `server/uninstall-ubuntu.sh` only on the VPS.
- Edit `server/config/setup.conf` when changing server-side values. After a successful install, generated values are also written back into `server/config/setup.conf` automatically.
- Server-side values include `XRAY_PORT`, `PUBLIC_IP`, `REALITY_SERVER_NAME`, `REALITY_DEST`, `REALITY_FINGERPRINT`, `XRAY_UUID`, `REALITY_PRIVATE_KEY`, `REALITY_PUBLIC_KEY`, `REALITY_SHORT_ID`, `SUB_TOKEN`, and `SUBSCRIPTION_PORT`.
- The installer requires root or sudo.
- The installer configures Xray, Caddy, then runs the distro-appropriate firewall-open script, and applies SELinux changes when applicable.
- The installer stops and disables the legacy Shadowsocks service if it exists, but keeps its config file in place.
- The installer prints the subscription URL at the end. That URL is meant for the personal computer side.
- The generated subscription YAML includes `proxies`, `proxy-groups`, and `rules`, so the personal computer can import the subscription directly in Clash Verge or Mihomo.

Typical VPS workflow:

1. Clone or copy this repository onto the VPS.
2. Check the VPS OS with `cat /etc/os-release`.
3. Copy `server/config/setup.conf.example` to `server/config/setup.conf`.
4. Edit `server/config/setup.conf`.
5. Run the matching installer:
   `sudo bash server/install-centos.sh`
   or
   `sudo bash server/install-ubuntu.sh`
6. Wait for the installer to finish. The effective install values, including generated credentials, are written into `server/config/setup.conf`.
7. Save the printed subscription URL.

### 2. Personal Computer Side

This is the local machine running Clash Verge, Mihomo, or another Clash-compatible client.

Relevant files:

- `client/render-client-configs.sh`
- `client/active-config/clash-verge.yaml`
- `client/active-config/clash-verge-check.yaml`
- `client/active-config/custom-routing-rules.yaml`
- `client/active-config/opencode-proxy.cmd`
- `client/validate-subscription.sh`

Agent rules on the personal computer side:

- Do not run VPS install commands on the personal computer.
- Do not treat local Clash files as VPS deployment files.
- Local Clash-related changes belong under `client/`.
- Treat `client/active-config/*` as public example templates, not as the user's private long-term local config.
- If the user asks to modify Clash local configuration, work on `client/active-config/*` or `client/render-client-configs.sh`.
- If the user only needs to use the server, importing the subscription URL into Clash Verge or Mihomo is the default path.
- Use `bash client/validate-subscription.sh` to verify that the generated Clash profile still contains a node, proxy groups, and routing rules.

Typical personal computer workflow:

1. Get the subscription URL produced on the VPS.
2. Import that URL into Clash Verge or Mihomo.
3. Enable the imported profile.
4. If custom local examples are needed, edit `server/config/setup.conf` values and run `bash client/render-client-configs.sh`.
5. If needed, validate the generated example profile with `bash client/validate-subscription.sh`.
6. Apply or adapt the files under `client/active-config/` locally only when subscription import is not enough.

## Operational Boundary

When deciding what to do, first determine the endpoint:

- If the task is about installing Xray, changing the REALITY port, opening firewall ports, configuring Caddy, rotating REALITY credentials, or publishing the subscription URL on the server, it is a VPS-side task.
- If the task is about Clash Verge profiles, routing rules, local proxy wrappers, importing subscriptions, or validating a generated Clash YAML on the personal computer, it is a personal-computer-side task.

If the endpoint is unclear, the agent should ask which side the user is working on before making changes.

## Safety

- Never commit real UUIDs, REALITY private keys, public keys, short IDs, subscription URLs, or private IPs.
- Treat `server/config/setup.conf` as private machine-specific configuration.
- Do not assume a local Clash config should be deployed to the VPS.
- Do not assume a VPS installation script should be run on the personal computer.
- Do not delete the legacy Shadowsocks config unless the user explicitly asks for full removal.
