# Clash VLESS REALITY Setup

Install Xray `VLESS + REALITY` on a VPS and publish a Clash Verge / Mihomo compatible subscription profile.

## Overview

This repository has two separate sides:

- VPS side: installs and configures Xray, Caddy, firewall rules, and the subscription endpoint.
- Personal computer side: imports the generated subscription URL into Clash Verge, Mihomo, or another Clash-compatible client.

Do not run VPS installation scripts on your personal computer.

## VPS Installation

Clone the repository on the VPS:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd clash-proxy-vless-setup
```

Check the VPS operating system first:

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```

Use the matching installer:

- Ubuntu or Debian-like systems: `server/install-ubuntu.sh`
- CentOS, RHEL, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, or Fedora-like systems: `server/install-centos.sh`

Create the private local configuration file:

```bash
cp server/config/setup.conf.example server/config/setup.conf
vi server/config/setup.conf
```

Common settings:

- `XRAY_PORT`
- `PUBLIC_IP`
- `PUBLIC_IPV6`
- `REALITY_SERVER_NAME`
- `REALITY_DEST`
- `SUBSCRIPTION_PORT`
- `CLASH_PROXY_NAME`
- `CLASH_DIRECT_EXTRA_DOMAINS`

`CLASH_DIRECT_EXTRA_DOMAINS` changes the server-managed defaults in the published subscription. Personal computer rules belong in `client/user-config/` instead.

Notes:

- `server/config/setup.conf.example` is only a template.
- `server/config/setup.conf` is private, machine-specific, and ignored by Git.
- Generated runtime values are written back to `server/config/setup.conf` after a successful install.
- `PUBLIC_IPV6=AUTO_DETECT` publishes an additional IPv6 REALITY node and IPv6 subscription URLs when the VPS has a globally routable IPv6 address. Set it to an explicit address when automatic detection is unavailable.
- Keep UUIDs, REALITY keys, short IDs, tokens, private IPs, and subscription URLs out of commits and public messages.

Run the installer with root privileges:

```bash
sudo bash server/install-ubuntu.sh
```

or:

```bash
sudo bash server/install-centos.sh
```

When installation finishes, the script prints the private IPv4 subscription and provider URLs. If `PUBLIC_IPV6` is available, it also prints IPv6 equivalents whose sslip.io hostnames resolve through AAAA records.

- Full subscription URL for Clash Verge and other subscription clients.
- Node provider URL ending in `-provider.yaml` for a local Mihomo config.

All URLs reuse `SUB_TOKEN`. Keep them private. The full subscription and provider files contain both IPv4 and IPv6 nodes when IPv6 publishing is enabled, so importing either URL provides both paths.

## Client Usage

On your personal computer:

1. Open Clash Verge, Mihomo, or another Clash-compatible client.
2. Create a new subscription profile.
3. Paste the subscription URL printed by the VPS installer.
4. Update the subscription.
5. Select and enable the imported profile.

The generated subscription profile includes:

- `proxies`
- `proxy-groups`
- `rules`

The VPS installer also writes generated examples to `client/local-config/`. That directory is ignored by Git and is never the source of personal routing rules.

## Personal Routing Rules

Personal domain rules are stored separately from the VPS subscription. Subscription updates cannot overwrite them.

Initialize the private local files on Windows:

```bat
.\client\manage-user-rules.cmd init
```

Edit these Git-ignored files:

- `client/user-config/direct-domains.txt`: one domain suffix per line routed through `DIRECT`.
- `client/user-config/proxy-domains.txt`: one domain suffix per line routed through the stable `PROXY` group.
- `client/user-config/provider-url.txt`: the private node provider URL printed by this project's VPS installer for a standalone Mihomo config.

Blank lines and `#` comments are ignored. Domains are normalized to lowercase and rendered as `DOMAIN-SUFFIX`. More specific subdomains are ordered before their parent domains. The same domain cannot appear in both policy files.

Validate the local inputs:

```bat
.\client\manage-user-rules.cmd validate
```

Generated files belong under `client/local-config/`:

- `clash-verge-user-rules.yaml`: persistent subscription enhancement rules.
- `mihomo.yaml`: complete local Mihomo config when `provider-url.txt` is configured.

To apply the Clash Verge rules:

1. Run `.\client\manage-user-rules.cmd copy`.
2. Right-click the current VPS subscription in Clash Verge Rev.
3. Select **Edit Rules**, then **Advanced**.
4. Paste, save, and update the subscription.

The rules use `prepend`, so personal choices win when a server-managed rule conflicts. The text files under `client/user-config/` are the source of truth; update them before copying again.

For standalone Mihomo, paste the provider URL printed by the VPS installer into `provider-url.txt`, run `.\client\manage-user-rules.cmd render`, and load `client/local-config/mihomo.yaml`. Mihomo updates nodes every hour while personal and server-default rule snapshots remain local. `render` fails rather than leaving a stale Mihomo file when the Provider URL is missing or invalid.

The old generated `custom-routing-rules.yaml` is no longer produced. Existing copies are legacy files and are not deleted automatically.

## Validation

Validate a generated local profile with:

```bash
bash client/validate-subscription.sh client/local-config/clash-verge-check.yaml
```

The validation checks for the required Clash profile sections and parses the YAML structure when PyYAML is available.

Run the local rule and rendering tests from the personal computer:

```powershell
& .\client\tests\manage-user-rules.tests.ps1
```

```bash
bash client/tests/render-configs.tests.sh
```

## Updating

After changing repository code or `server/config/setup.conf`, rerun the matching VPS installer:

```bash
sudo bash server/install-ubuntu.sh
```

or:

```bash
sudo bash server/install-centos.sh
```

Tracked files under `client/active-config/` are public examples. Generated machine-local files belong under `client/local-config/`. Personal inputs under `client/user-config/` are not regenerated or tracked by Git.

If `SUB_TOKEN` changes, replace the URL in `client/user-config/provider-url.txt` and rerun `render`. The domain files do not need to change. If a Clash Verge subscription is deleted and re-imported, run `copy` and paste the rules into the new profile once.

## Uninstall

Ubuntu or Debian-like systems:

```bash
sudo bash server/uninstall-ubuntu.sh
```

CentOS, RHEL, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, or Fedora-like systems:

```bash
sudo bash server/uninstall-centos.sh
```
